# Game Assistant Multi-Instance Instructions

The game assistant supports running multiple instances simultaneously to operate multiple game accounts. The number of instances is not limited by the software but depends on your computer's hardware configuration.

## Multi-Instance Methods

### Method One: Direct Multi-Instance

- Simply double-click the exe file to start a new game assistant instance
- Each new instance needs to refill the corresponding emulator instance's port number
- Note: With this method, all instances share the same configuration

**Suitable scenarios**: Temporary need for multiple instances, or when configuration differences between emulators are small

### Method Two: Folder Isolation (Recommended)

- Copy the game assistant exe file to different folders
- The exe in each folder will independently save its own configuration
- Each folder can be named to distinguish different roles or purposes

**Suitable scenarios**: Long-term multiple instances, or when configuration differences between emulators are significant

## Multi-Instance Notes

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Ensure your computer has sufficient memory and processing power
   - For each additional instance, it is recommended to have at least 2GB of extra memory space

2. **Emulator Configuration**:
   - Each emulator instance needs to be set up separately and its port number recorded
   - Port numbers for multiple BlueStacks emulator instances are different from each other
